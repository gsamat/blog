I like having bookmarks to cloud apps on my Dock with beautiful icons.

If you drag your safari address bar to dock you get @-on-a-spin without right icon and you can't assign custom icon to it.

To add custom icons to dock links:

1. copy image you would like to see as icon to buffer (⌘+C)
2. drag safari address bar to desktop
3. "Get info" on that desktop link (⌘+i)
4. click on current icon on top-left corner of info windows
5. paste your image (⌘+v)

Now you can drag this "link file" to dock.
